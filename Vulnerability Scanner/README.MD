1. Run the recon script: python reconscan.py 192.168.1.10
2. Wait for the scan to finish.
3. Browse the mapping-linux.md and mapping-windows.md from the folder named with the IP address of the host you scanned in a browser to see the results.

Please note:
- The vulnerability scanner was based from https://github.com/xapax/oscp
- A lot of modifications were needed to catch possibile errors that were caught during the tests
- This script has been tested thoroughly on the following machines:
	* SickOS 1.1
	* SickOS 1.2
	* Kioptrix Levels 1-5

- Privilege escalation is a bit tedious as this needs to be checked manually. 
- I've included a few scripts that you can use for privilege escalation however I have found that linuxprivchecker.py is enough for linux.
- For windows, just follow the output of the reconscan.py and you should be fine.
